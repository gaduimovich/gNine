# Special game of life example.

# This is all a little convoluted in camke.
# All we want to do run pixsmal with game_of_life.psm with the glider_gun.png image
# and then run game_of_life.psm on the output from that, and again on the output from that etc...
# 
# Supreme surprise: this ends up simulating Conway's game of life. After a successful build
# you should see a number game_of_life_<number>.png images. Flick though them and you should see a
# glider gun making... gliders!

# Loop to generate lots of iterations of game of life.
